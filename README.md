### Hi, I'm Lester Wee! 👋

Curious and amazed with how application of technologies can solve real world problems.

With a leap of faith, I left my job and pursue a career switch in tech. Motivated and eager to learn, I completed the Web Development Bootcamp with Le Wagon on 5 Dec 22. Ever since then, I love coding and I aspire to build my own product.

I'm a Full Stack Developer now, continuing a lifelong journey of learning and projects. Open to Full Stack Developer or Product Developer roles.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on building my own portfolio website and practicing Leetcode Challenges
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on web development projects based in Ruby on Rails framework
